# Sudoku Solver
For someone that loves puzzles and brain teasers, I'm remarkably average at sudoku. After building out Conway's Game of Life in an Object Oriented Programming course, I realized that the fundamentals of Sudoku are not that different: the state of each cell can be determined by applying a set of rules on the other cells. With this in mind, I set up an Observer design pattern and aimed to develop a sudoku solver that doesn't rely on backtracking, choosing instead to teach the system one sudoku strategy at a time to level it up!


## Technologies Used
- C++
- Observer Pattern



## Project Status
> After developing a proof of concept with beginner and intermediate sudoku solving strategies taken from [Learn Sudoku](https://www.learn-sudoku.com/basic-techniques.html), I was satisfied with the result. Next steps would include adding more and more strategies and a GUI.

All in all, this project was a lot of fun and I was I learned a lot!
- There's so much more to sudoku than looking at columns rows and groups to get the last number, a LOT more
- Applying the observer design pattern to a personal project
- This was one of the first projects I used version control on, haven't looked back since
